              <p className='desc'>
                Before diving into the visa application process, it's crucial to
                decide where you want to study. Consider factors like the
                quality of education, cost of living, language, culture, and
                your career goals. Each country may have slightly different visa
                requirements, so your destination will impact the specific steps
                you need to follow.

              <p className='desc'>
                Once you've chosen a destination, it's time to pick the right
                course and educational institution. Verify that your chosen
                course is eligible for a student visa in your chosen country.
                Furthermore, check if the institution is accredited and
                recognized by the relevant authorities.

              <h5 className="sub-title">Understanding Visa Types</h5>
              <p className='desc'>
                Student visas come in various types, depending on the country.
                For example, the United States has the F-1 visa, while the
                United Kingdom offers the Tier 4 (General) visa. It's essential
                to understand the type of visa you need for your specific course
                and institution.

                costs. You may need to provide bank statements, scholarship
                letters, or financial guarantees. Be sure to understand the
                financial requirements for your chosen destination.
