          Canada has established itself as an immensely high benchmark for
          academic standards and has rigorous processes to uphold quality that
          ultimately are designed to broaden opportunities for the longer term.
          For a country that measures high amongst the OECD countries in terms

          surprisingly lower than one may speculate, especially when compared
          with other supreme education hubs such as the USA and UK. Furthermore,
          a total of 13 Universities from Canada are recognized in the world’s
          Top 200 by QS including 3 that appear to be in the Top 50. If you are
